Exercises to learn about linear and logistic regression
Description:
In March and April 2019, we are running a learning group called _Make predictions with machine learning (for beginners)_

This is where the code exercises live.

Description for the learning group:

We will cover a couple fundamental machine learning algorithms that you can use to make predictions. If you’re 
curious about machine learning but you’ve not learned about it formally, or you’ve never learned via playing with data 
yourself, these sessions are for you. 

We will cover linear and logistic regression. Linear regression can be used to make real valued predictions like: 
how much a house will sell for? Logistic regression can be used to make classifiers, for example: is this email spam or 
not? We also need an optimisation algorithm for both linear and logistic regression, so we will cover a classic: gradient 
descent.  

We will round things off by applying what we’ve learned to make a binary classifier based on the Titanic dataset:

Notes will be available after each session, and each session will have exercises. Since each topic depends on the one 
previous, it’s probably best to still go through the notes and exercises if you need to miss a session. The exercises will be prepared in Scala, so if you’re not terribly familiar with Scala you can pair up with someone who is. 

Ongoing news at the Learning Group(s) channel. 

Rough outline:

Week 1: Introduction and linear regression

Week 2: Gradient Descent and linear regression wrap up

Week 3: Linear algebra review + vectorising your gradient descent implementation

Week 4: Logistic regression + applying it to the Titanic dataset

Week 5: If we get behind, then finishing up the previous topics
